### Final Document

#### Objectif
#### For the final project, we were supposed to do something using one of our computer science skills. 
#### For my final project, I have decided to make a website using HTML.  Since I started college and
#### my mother found out I was doing computer science, she wanted me to make her a website for her 
#### clothes.  She is a seamstress, she makes clothes out of African fabric for men and women.  
#### So I decided to make her a website.

#### Materials
#### I really didn't need much for my project. Since I had to create the website from scratch, I used 
#### NotePad ++ and took pictures from my sister's facebook page and some that I had in my phone.

#### What I learned
#### My web developpment was not as good as it is right now.  Through out this process, I had friends 
#### helped me and showed me how to play around with HTML.  Doing this project, have improved my web 
#### developping skills and I also  learned time management is the key special if I am going to have
#### to deal with clients and deadlines in the future.

#### Conclusion
#### My website is coming along because of time, I feel like insstead of making it a short time project
#### I turned it into a long term project.  My pages needs a lot of working, so for right now it  is 
#### just sort of a prototype.  I plan to finish this project soon or later.
