## Final Document

### Objectif
### For the final project, we were supposed to do something using one of our computer science skills. 
### For my final project, I have decided to make a website using HTML.  Since I started college and
### my mother found out I was doing computer science, she wanted me to make her a website for her 
### clothes.  She is a seamstress, she makes clothes out of African fabric for men and women.  
### So I decided to make her a website.

### Materials
### I really didn't need much for my project. Since I had to create the website from scratch, I used 
### NotePad ++ and took pictures from my sister's facebook page and some that I had in my phone.
