	 ### For my final project, I have decided to make a clothing website for my mother’s business since
   she always talking about having a website and this also will be a perfect practice for me to see 
   how far I am with my web development skills since CSC 110.  The purpose of this website is to enable
   people who do not live in Charlottesville to be able to get clothes from my mother without having to
   travel like some have the costume to do.  It will also be easy for people who live in Charlottesville
   if they want their clothes right away. 

    ###	First, I will brainstorm how I want the website to like.  Second, design the website and pick which language
  I want to use in my coding.  Third, look for the pictures where people are wearing my mom’s design and put them
  in a file that I will be able to get to easily.  Fourth, I will make the website hoping that it comes out good 
  and then last, test to see that everything is working the way it supposed to.

	  ### The risk that I am afraid of is that I will not know how to make everything work because this is a very advanced
  website that I have ever done so it a little intimidating but for a final project and I just want to prove to 
  myself that this is the right career path,  I am up for the challenge even it means sleepless nights. 

	   ### I am very excited about this project.  So I am hoping that it will com out good and that my mother and I will
  benefit from this project.
