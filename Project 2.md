## Project two raftdraft

   After talking to my professor and finally finding out that we can do anything for our  final project.
  Well as long as it's appropriate for the class.  I was debating between  making a game using python or
  making a website using HTML.
       
   I have decided to make a website because my family member have been asking me to make them  all different
 kinds of websites so this will be my change to start some of the project they have been trowing my way and 
 also expend my skills from last semeter. With that said, I will be making an African clothing website.
