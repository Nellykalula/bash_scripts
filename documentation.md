##Objective

	The objective of this project was to set up a software called Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
##Materials 

	At the beginning of the project I decided to use a laptop to set up my server.  I thought it was the easy way out but I did have  a lot of difficulties setting it up.  In fact, everybody who used a laptop thinking that it was an easy way out were wrong, because it was the hardest.
After having difficulties, my teacher suggested to install linux.  Linux showed a lot progress that I was not even close to when I was using the laptop.  Since then I have been working with Ubuntu using  online tutorials, one of them found at   http://www.codeography.com/2012/09/23/howto-irc-server.html


##What I learned

	Throughout this process I have Learned how to: Set up Linux, follow tutorial better than Iâ€™ve ever had, download, install and setup a software using keyboard.  Most importantly, I have learned that even though the objective was to set up an IRC but what counts more is not just getting it up and running but learning how to do it so next time you can get it to work. 
##Conclusion

	After working on this project for about a month, I was not able to set up the server.  When writting this code I did not run into a problem until after downloading it like on the tutorial, then when it comes to finding it so I can install it.  That's when it became difficult. It will always tell me "command not found."  My suggestion is if anybody want a successful running server, do not take the laptop route.  It is an easy option in this case but in reality it is not, so use the raspberry pie instead
